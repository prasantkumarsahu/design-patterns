# Abstract Factory Pattern

- Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under **_creational pattern_** as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
- In Abstract Factory pattern an **_interface_** is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.
