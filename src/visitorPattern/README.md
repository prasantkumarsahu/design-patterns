# Visitor Pattern


- In Visitor pattern, we use a visitor class which changes the executing algorithm of an element class. By this way, execution algorithm of element can vary as and when visitor varies.


- This pattern comes under **_behavior_** pattern category. As per the pattern, element object has to accept the visitor object so that visitor object handles the operation on the element object.
